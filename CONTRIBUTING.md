# Contributing to Transcriptase
We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed the API, update the README.md and Storybook docs.
4. Add the correct Github label to your PR (ex: documentation, enhancement, etc.)
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/asabaylus/react-command-palette/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/asabaylus/react-command-palette/issues/new/choose); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code
The Bug template in GitHub makes this easy 

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:
* A desciption of the bug
* Steps to reproduce
* Expected behavior
* Screenshots
* Desktop / Smartphone details
 - Device: [e.g. iPhone6]
 - OS: [e.g. iOS8.1]
 - Browser [e.g. stock browser, safari]
 - Version [e.g. 22]
* Additional context


People *love* thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.
